        <!-- What is OOP?-->
        <div>
            <h2> What is OOP</h2>
            <p>OOP is object oriented programming. It involves the usage of classes and objects. A class is a template
                for an object, something like a generic blueprint for a building or item. A class will have attributes
                and methods. Attributes are characteristics or properties of the class. For example, if we used a human
                as an example for a class, an attribute of the human class could be height, weight, or eye color. A
                method, or behaviour, is an action or set of actions that can be accomplished by the class. Back to the
                human case, a human can run, it can grow, and it can eat. These would all be examples of methods. An
                object is something that is created from the class. Looking back to the human example. We can say that
                there is a general human class, one that can apply for all of us. We can walk, we can grow, and we can
                eat. However, we might have different attributes, like varying heights or weights.</p>
            <p>All objects take up a certain portion of memory in the system. This allows them to be located and
                accessed, similar to variables. All objects will have behaviours, which are its methods, and state,
                which is its properties, or variables. To compare classes and objects, let's look at a classic example,
                the cookie cutter and the cookie. Cutting dough using a cookie cutter makes a cookie. The cookie cutter
                would be the class, and the cookie would be the object. You can create many cookies, but they all come
                from the same cookie cutter you just used. </p>
            <p>One other property of classes is their static methods. Static methods are part of a class, but they are
                not part of the objects they create. In the cookie cutter example, this would be how the cookie cutter
                is sharp, but the cookie is not. This gives the static method the interesting property that it does not
                need an object to be created to run. </p>

            <p>Now, letâ€™s look at OOP from a computer programming perspective. First of all, there can only be one
                public class defined in every java file. This class will have the same name as the file, and should be
                capitalized. </p>

            <pre>
            //Class name must match the file name. In this case, the file is called Human.java
            public Human{
    
                //Instance Variables
                private int height;
                private double weight;
                private String name;
            
            
                //Class constructor
                public Human(int h, double w, String n){
                    height = h;
                    wieght = w;
                    name = n;
                }

                //Class constructor with only the name
                public Human(String name){
                    Human(100,50,name);
                }
            
                //Default no argument constructor
                public Human(){
                    Human(100,50,"No Name");
                }
            
                //Class methods
                public void doSomething(){
                    System.out.println("I did something.");
                }
            
                public void eat(){
                    //Code for eating...
                }
            }
        </pre>
            <p>When declaring attributes, or instance variables for your class, they should be set to private to prevent
                access from outside of the class unless allowed by get and set methods. Get and set methods are methods
                which are specifically designed to only change or access the value of an instance variable. On the other
                hand, methods should be declared public, unless they are helper methods which should not be used outside
                of the class. </p>

            <p>Another important thing about classes is their class constructor. A class constructor is a method which
                creates an instance of the class, or an object. All classes should have a constructor. The constructor
                should declare the values of the instance variables, and the instance variables should not be
                initialized with values. The constructor can take specific values so that the initial values of the
                constructor can be changed. </p>

            <p>What about an object? Earlier, it was stated that an object is the instance of a class. An object is
                created using a class constructor, and can access all the public methods available in the class. An
                object should be declared like a variable, with the type being the name of the class. It is created by
                using the new keyword, followed by the class constructor. .</p>
            <pre>
            //Here we create an object using the Human class constructor
            Human joe = new Human("Joe");
        </pre>

            <p>What is the benefit of using object oriented programming vs using procedural programming? Although object
                oriented takes more time to write, it is much easier to organize your code, as each class can have a
                specific job or function that they need to perform. This is especially important in large projects,
                where multiple people have to collaborate together. Using object oriented programming allows the
                programmers to separate the work easily and combine the final product together much more easily compared
                to procedural programming.</p>
