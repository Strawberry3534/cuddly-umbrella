            <h1>Recursion</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Recursion is the act of a method invoking or calling itself. Recursion is used in methods which use
                divide and conquer, a process in which a problem is split into smaller, simpler problems repeatedly
                until they become either easier or trivial to solve. Some examples of this include quicksort, binary
                search, and mergesort. </p>
            <p>A recursive method can be split into two parts; a recursive case and a base case. A recursive case is one
                in which a method calls itself to solve a problem, but the problem will be simpler in most cases. A base
                case is the final case which ends the recursive calls, ending the recursion process. All recursive
                methods must have a base case, otherwise, they will be stuck in an infinite loop, causing a stack
                overflow error. It is called a stack overflow error because Java uses a data structure called a stack to
                keep track of recursive calls. When a base case is never reached, the stack will reach its limit,
                causing it to overflow. When a recursive method reaches its base case, it will return a value which can
                be used in the 2nd last call, and the value in the 2nd last call can be used in the 3rd last call, etcâ€¦
            </p>
            <pre>
                //pseudocode for a basic recursive function
                recursiveFunction(int num):
                    if num is base case:
                        return some number
                    
                    return recursiveFunction(num + an increment)
            </pre>
            <p>
                Here we have a method which takes an integer. If the number is equivalent to our base case, we return.
                Something about going up the stack. The other line is the recursive call, where the parameter is
                slightly changed so that it becomes closer to the base case.
            </p>
            <p>
                What are the benefits and disadvantages of recursive methods? It was previously stated that recursive
                methods can be used to make problems simpler, and they can also be used as a replacement as iterative
                methods. Let's use an example of binary search. In binary search, the while loop can be replaced with
                a recursive statement or two.
            </p>
            <pre>
                //Binary search recursive implementation
                public static int binarySearch(int target, int[] arr, int low, int high){
                    if (high >= 1){
                        int mid = (low+high)/2;

                        // target is at mid
                        if (arr[mid] == target)
                            return mid;
                        
                        // target is left of mid
                        if (arr[mid] > target)
                            return binarySearch(target, arr, low, mid - 1);

                        // target is right of mid
                        return binarySearch(target, arr, mid + 1, high)
                    }
                }
            </pre>
            <p>
                Recursion can also be used in place of many other iterative algorithms, such as calculating
                factorials.The factorial is known as the product of all the positive integers less than
                or equal the integer. For example, 5 factorial, or 5!, would be 5*4*3*2*1. This can also be represented
                algebraically. n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)...*2*1, or n! = n * (n-1)!. We will be
                using the latter definition in our recursive implementation
                Let's show the code and then explain how it works.
            </p>
            <pre>
                //Factorial recursive implementation
                public static int factorial(int num){
                    if (num &lt;= 1){
                        return 1;
                    }
                    
                    return num * factorial(num -1);
                }

                public static void main(String[] args){
                    factorial(5); // returns 120
                }
            </pre>
            <p>
                Here, we call the factorial method, and our num is 5. Our method doesnt know what 5! is, so but it knows
                that the result will be 5 * 4!, so it tries to solve for 4!.
                When it tries to solve for 4!, it cant do that either, so it solves for 4 * 3!. This process repeats
                until we reach 1!. When num is 1, we know that 1! is 1, so we return it.
                Now, we can solve for 2!, which is 2*1 = 2. This allows us to solve for 3!, which is 3*2 = 6.
                We can also solve for 4!, 4*6 = 24, and finally, 120, 5*24 = 120. What we have just down is call
                recursive methods until we reach a base case, and then once the base case is reached, we go up the stack
                until we reach the initial call.
            </p>

                Another common usage of recursion is it's usage in sorting algorithms. Almost every, if not all of the
                more efficient sorting algorithms implement some sort of recursion. Let's look at the simplest one,
                merge sort.Like binary search, it is a divide and conquer algorithm, which means it seperates a large
                problem into smaller problems until they become simpler or trivial to solve. Merge sort halves arrays
                until they are of size of length 1, and then they merge back up while maintaining a sorted order.
            </p>
            <pre>
    //Merge sort Java, taken from GeeksForGeeks
    void merge(int arr[], int l, int m, int r)
    {
        // Find sizes of two subarrays to be merged
        int n1 = m - l + 1;
        int n2 = r - m;
 
        /* Create temp arrays */
        int L[] = new int[n1];
        int R[] = new int[n2];
 
        /*Copy data to temp arrays*/
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; n1; ++i)
            L[i] = arr[l + i];
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; n2; ++j)
            R[j] = arr[m + 1 + j];
 
        /* Merge the temp arrays */
 
        // Initial indexes of first and second subarrays
        int i = 0, j = 0;
 
        // Initial index of merged subarray array
        int k = l;
        while (i &lt; n1 && j &lt; n2) {
            if (L[i] &lt;= R[j]) {
                arr[k] = L[i];
                i++;
            }
            else {
                arr[k] = R[j];
                j++;
            }
            k++;
        }
 
        /* Copy remaining elements of L[] if any */
        while (i &lt; n1) {
            arr[k] = L[i];
            i++;
            k++;

            k++;
        }
    }
 
    // Main function that sorts arr[l..r] using
    // merge()
    void sort(int arr[], int l, int r)
    {
        if (l &lt; r) {
            // Find the middle point
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
 
            // Sort first and second halves
            sort(arr, l, m);
            sort(arr, m + 1, r);
 
            // Merge the sorted halves
            merge(arr, l, m, r);
