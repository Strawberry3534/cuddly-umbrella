            Our ICS4U0 Final Project, created by myself and my partner, Raymond Ouyang. Our game aims to teach the user
            about video game toxicity, the forms of video game toxicity, and how to combat it. It contains 3 levels, a
            learning level, a maze level, and an action level. In the learning level, you can learn about video game
            toxicity. In the maze level, you navigate a maze, with questions in the center of each crossroad. Answering
            the questions correctly will allow you to progress. In the action level, you face off against an AI who is stronger
            than you. Responding to their toxicity correctly will allow you to gain buffs to beat the AI.
